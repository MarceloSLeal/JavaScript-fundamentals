1. Create a _Counter_ factory with:
    * A private *_value* property initiated with 0.
    * A public *getValue* method.

    Initialize and assign it to a variable and make a call to getValue from outside printing the counter value;

2. Add to _Counter_:
    * A private *_changeValueBy* method to change it's value.
    * A public _increment_ method that calls *_changeValueBy*;
    * A public _decrement_ method that calls *_changeValueBy*;

    Initialize two counters and make subsequent calls to increment and decrement then compare values of each counter instance;
